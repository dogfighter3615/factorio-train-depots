# factorio-train-depots
a script to send trains to depots if they dont have any stations to go to at the moment

Add the names where of the depot stations to the mod settings, and watch the trains go there when they need to.

settings: 
  -station name -> names of the stations the trains have to go to when they need to go to a depot.
  -time between checks -> time between the checks for trains at depot stations if they should leave in ticks. by default set to 60.

planned features:
  -Currently I have no big plans for updates, but this can always change of course.
